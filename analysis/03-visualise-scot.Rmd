## Length of speech

```{r}
ggplot(covid_speeches_scot, aes(x = n_words)) +
  geom_density(color = scotblue, fill = scotblue, alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of number of words",
    subtitle = "of Scotland daily briefings",
    x = "Number of words",
    y = "Density"
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank())
```

```{r}
lm_words <- lm(n_words ~ date, data = covid_speeches_scot)
lm_words_rsq <- glance(lm_words)$r.squared

covid_speeches_scot %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = n_words)) +
  geom_point(color = scotblue, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = date, y = n_words), method = lm, formula = y ~ x, color = "darkgray") +
  labs(
    title = "Length of Scotland COVID-19 speeches",
    subtitle = glue("Measured in number of words, R-squared = {percent(lm_words_rsq)}"),
    x = NULL, y = "Number of words", color = NULL, shape = NULL
  )
```

## Word frequency

```{r fig.asp = 0.8}
covid_speeches_scot_words %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  filter(n > 1000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = fct_reorder(word, n), x = n, fill = n)) +
  geom_col() +
  guides(fill = FALSE)
```

## Remove stop words

```{r remove-stop-words}
covid_speeches_scot_words <- covid_speeches_scot_words %>%
  anti_join(stop_words)
```

## Word frequency again

```{r fig.asp = 0.8}
threshold <- 500

covid_speeches_scot_words %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  filter(n > threshold) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = fct_reorder(word, n), x = n, fill = log(n))) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "Frequency of words in Scotland COVID-19 briefings",
    subtitle = glue("Words occurring more than {threshold} times"),
    y = NULL, x = NULL
  )
```

## Sentiment analysis

Sentiments: Positive and negative.

```{r fig.asp = 0.8}
covid_speeches_scot_words %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing"), by = "word") %>%
  count(sentiment, word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  group_by(sentiment) %>%
  slice_head(n = 20) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = fct_reorder(word, n), x = n, fill = sentiment)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~sentiment, scales = "free") +
  labs(
    title = "Sentiment and frequency of words in Scotland COVID-19 briefings",
    subtitle = "Bing lexicon",
    y = NULL, x = NULL
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(light_red, light_blue))
```

"positive" isn't really a positive word in this context. Remove and plot again.

```{r fig.asp = 0.8}
covid_speeches_scot_words %>%
  filter(word != "positive") %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing"), by = "word") %>%
  count(sentiment, word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  group_by(sentiment) %>%
  slice_head(n = 20) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = fct_reorder(word, n), x = n, fill = sentiment)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~sentiment, scales = "free") +
  labs(
    title = "Sentiment and frequency of words in Scotland COVID-19 briefings",
    subtitle = "Bing lexicon",
    y = NULL, x = NULL
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(light_red, light_blue))
```

## Briefing sentiments

### Lexicon: Bing

Sentiments: Positive and negative.

```{r}
covid_speeches_scot_words %>%
  filter(word != "positive") %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing"), by = "word") %>%
  count(date, sentiment) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = sentiment, values_from = n) %>%
  mutate(sentiment = positive - negative) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = sentiment)) +
  geom_line(color = "gray") +
  geom_point(aes(color = sentiment > 0, shape = sentiment > 0), size = 2, alpha = 0.8, show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "lightgray") +
  labs(
    title = "Sentiment in Scotland COVID-19 briefings",
    subtitle = "Sentiment score calculated as the number of positive - the number of negative words in each briefing,\naccording to the Bing lexicon",
    x = "Date of briefing", y = "Sentiment score (positive - negative)"
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(light_red, light_blue))
```

and now with a smooth curve...

```{r}

  mutate(sentiment = positive - negative) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = sentiment)) +
  geom_smooth(color = "gray", method = "loess", formula = y ~ x) +
  geom_point(aes(color = sentiment > 0, shape = sentiment > 0), size = 2, alpha = 0.8, show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "lightgray") +
  labs(
    title = "Sentiment in Scotland COVID-19 briefings",
    subtitle = "Sentiment score calculated as the number of positive - the number of negative words\nin each briefing, according to the Bing lexicon",
    x = "Date of briefing", y = "Sentiment score (positive - negative)"
